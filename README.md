# AutoNotify


This plugin is designed to help create automatic email notifications when sensitive responses are received from a survey. Originally based on Autonotify plugin by Andy Martin. (thank you so much, Andy!) As of June 2016, it support multiple notification emails in addition to multiple triggers. The new version offers the ability to upgrade existing autonitfy configurations on first use.

It must be used in conjunction with a data entry trigger to function in real-time.
The settings for each project are stored as an encoded variable (an) in the query string of the DET.
